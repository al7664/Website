            The story in this video is about “The Little Things” because the little things can make you go from a bad to a good day. In the beginning, the audience can see a dinosaur having a bad day because they got a bad grade on an assignment as seen by the 10/100 paper. However, someone soon gives a flower to the dinosaur which in the end, changes the dino’s mood as seen by the sun and change in expression.

            In this 3-in-1 One Shot video, I utilized a fish eye lens by attaching the lens on my phone and locking the camera to make sure it doesn't automatically switch cameras.
            By doing so, I hope to add another softer touch to the video, and bring a new perspective as the fish eye lens widens the space captured, providing me with more space
            to include intentional material in the shot.

            However, the obstacles of using a one shot is making sure the props change on time and not visibly. For this project, I learned to plan out the shots through making a 
            storyboard, communicating when an object needs to exit and designing the space to make sure I can keep control of the props outside of the lens.
            I imagined that if I had someone else shooting the scene instead of myself, creating a storyboard would allow them to visually see how much I want to 
            capture and how.
