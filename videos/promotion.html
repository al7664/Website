            Holding positions at school, such as being a Resident Assistant, has led me to crearte promotional videos.
            An examle would be this Resident Assistant Promotion Video that was created to inform vieweres on the role by providing perspectives from both sides.
            For this video, I interviewed Residents and Resident Assistants through a drawing question format where they would draw a question from a box. 
            This allowed me to create a more comfortable environment for the interviewees.
        </p>

            As this video was shared on Instagram, I utilized the "Friends" theme song which matched with the home environment at the Residence Halls. 
            I spent most of my time on the intro in aligning the scenes with the sounds. 
            During the intro, I wanted to ensure that each scene wasn't cutting too fast by making sure the text was visible for at least three seconds.
            I also wanted to create a video that viewers could understand without hearing the sound, so I spent time labeling questions, names, and captions.
        </p>
        <p>    
            The main difference between creating a personal and promotion video was the motive behind the camera. 
            For promotion videos, I had more things I wanted to control as I wanted to relay positive perspectives of the role.
