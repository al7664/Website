            My proposal for Project A relates to pollution in which a Smogaura ruins a once colorful world. 
            As I envision Smogaura to be a creature that is mainly composed of ellipses and circles, I wanted the background to be created with more squares and rectangles to draw more of a contrast between the background and the creature. 
            As I wanted to create a world that uses a lot of energy, I wanted to incorporate a background that is more AI and technological. 
            For inspiration for patterns, I looked up static backgrounds on Pinterest, and combined them in a drive for inspiration:

            In this project, I spent time putting different numerical inputs in each variable to see how it would change my product. 
            For example, for the random colors, fill (random(255), random (255), random (255)) by editing the last variable I was able to change how saturated I wanted my RGB colors to be. 
            For instance, by putting in a lower number, like 10, my design came out to be a lot paler (left), and by putting in a large number like 200, the colors got a lot brighter (middle). 
            As I wanted something brighter, I chose to put the last variable between 100-150 depending on the pattern (right).

            Editing the pi variable (rotate (PI/ x)) also allowed me to rotate the canvas by certain angles. 
            By putting in a larger number, I caused the canvas to be rotated more times creating a more dramatic swirling effect (seen on the right).

            I also edited other variables for translation (changes in the locations the rectangles are drawn at), scales (to manage the range of size I want my shapes), and the total shapes (i less than x) to control the patterns in my canvas. 
            I also attempted to incorporate random in all of these functions to get a different canvas each time. 
            For certain patterns, I also utilized push and pop to save and restore the patterns I created in my canvas.

            Compared to hand sketching, programming on the computer allows for more accurate straight lines, as equations are being used. 
            In this way, it provides convenience when users want to create a certain shape and replicate it on a canvas. 
            However, I think I would prefer hand drawing things such as faces as I wouldn't have to consider the specific equation I used in my code. 
            For commonalities, certain styles are similar to coding and hand. 
            For instance, using the transparency function reminds me of using watercolors. 
        </p>

            In the project, I explored variables in transformation, scale, rotation, and random. 
            By changing the variables I was able to edit the pattern whether I wanted a swirl design or a neater pattern. 
            A good generative pattern differs differently from user to user as we all have our unique aesthetic. 
            Depending on the overall feelings and connections the user wants to create, each user would envision a different pattern. 
            I imagine a good generative pattern would depict the user's connections straightforwardly to the audience.
