            In the “Story of Your Life” written by Ted Chiang. 
            The linguistic communication between humans and the aliens is that the aliens “act to create the future, to enact chronology.” 
            In our drawing, we incorporated different dumplings from different cultures across the world. 
            Starting from the left of the drawing, There is Gyoza, fried dumplings from Japan, and Cha Shao Bao from Guangzhou. 
            Shrimp Dim Sum pronounced (Har Gow), a popular dim sum dish from Guangzhou, and Siu Mai from dim sum. 
            Both are popular dishes in Dim Sum Lastly, empanadas from South America. 
            These are all different dumpling cuisines from all over the world with different flavors and tastes. 
        </p>

            Dumplings in Chinese Culture represented a bright start to the new year. 
            In Chinese history, dumplings were served during the spring festivals for the celebration of the upcoming new year. 
            Dim Sum culture in China started in Guangzhou when people wanted to have food to accompany their tea. 
            In Japan, gyoza represents wealth and prosperity, and it is a Japanese pronunciation of the word Jiaozi. 
            In South America, empanadas served as an important food resource because it was a meal that would keep many people in the family full. 
            Therefore, it served delicious filling food. Even in China itself, there are different “dumplings” across all the provinces. 
            Many provinces in China have their way of making dumplings. 
            One example is in Fujian, my hometown they have their unique dumplings called “Bian Rou” which are Fujian-based Wonton soup stuffed with chopped greens and ground meat. 
            In addition, Taro Dumplings from Fujian, where the skin is made from taro and stuffed with pork and veggies. 
            These are two dumpling types that represent home for me.
        </p> 
            Overall, in China, there are different types of dumplings, but everyone in China will always cherish Jiaozi. 
            Jiaozi is crucial to Chinese culture because it symbolizes family union during holidays, luck for the new year, and good fortune. 
            This serves as a strong correlation with the Heptapods in “Story of Your Life” because the choices we humans make affect our future and the ways aliens think in terms of the future. 
            No matter how different the human language is from the Heptapods, the performative language,” in which the language itself is an action. 
            As a result, actions are more meaningful than words. 
            Just like the dumplings, they are a way to express the different cultures and different histories in different places through the process of making food. 
            Throughout, different provinces' inventions of different dumplings are a performative language itself. 
            Each different dumpling across the world tells an individual story. No matter if it is Empanadas, Cha Shao Bao, or Gyoza. 
            In conclusion, all of these different dumplings come across to express the same message that food can be a significant way of communication.
