            In this video, I explained the process of folding a paper star. 
            To do so within the time frame, I had to decide which frames to slow down and which frames to speed up. 
            I sped up on repetitive steps in the process, and held the screen longer whenever I wanted the audience to see the specific step clearly. 
            For transitions, I utilized different fade in and spin in order to add to the atmosphere of the James Bond music, as seen in the beginning, the spin refers to the iconic James Bond cool spin shot scene. 
            I also utilized a reverse transition in the end to “clean up” the frame and also draw a conclusion to the video better.

            The song I utilized was the well known James Bond movie. 
            In previous DIY videos, they often use softer music (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZdO2e8K29o), however by utilizing a well-known upbeat song, I hope to motivate the audience more. 
            In order to match the songs better, I planned the transitions timely in order to make everything more smoother.  
        </p>
        On the other hand, I would need to keep in mind how the music choice might overshadow and control the video. 
        I also need to plan out the time span of the wording, especially the end credits, in order to let the audience see the words and citations longer.
