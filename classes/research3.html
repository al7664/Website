            “Unbroken belief” in this text discusses the differences between conventional concrete works versus abstract authentic works. 
            For conventional works, there is an unbroken belief whereas in abstract works there is “no more unbroken belief in their truth (Steyerl). 
            The undefined emotions relayed from the abstract works break down standards as there are endless possibilities. 
            However, this is caused by the “uncertainty of representation” because the audience can see less definite representation. 
            Because there is no longer a direct story, the work is open to the imagination of the audience.   
        </p>
        <p>
            In this aspect, conventional work is like the truth that informs fiction while abstract works are like fiction that informs truth. 
            Referring back, conventional works show set features which make the audience think they are a reality, as readers believe facts. 
            However, in actuality, those conventional works might not show as much as abstract facts. 
            Even though abstract images are free and not as focused as conventional, they allow people to imagine endless possibilities, as seen in fictional works. 
            Even though the work may seem undefined and free, the image still represents the truth more because of the uncertainty of the abstract features.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking at movies and films based on a true story, there are manipulations in order to let the audience draw connections easier. 
            However, because of this, we lose the authenticity of the work. 
            If we kept the authenticity of the work, there might be more. confusion as there might be more unusual ideas, however, it's exactly those unusual ideas that make it realistic, making the work authentically real. 
            This feeds back to the “unbroken belief” as conventional works are manipulated to be clearer to the audience. 
            Yet, if we kept certain features original, even if they may be blurred and undefined, it keeps the authentic reality. 
        </p>

            Personally, I think it is important to keep the authenticity of reality in media. 
            Manipulation causes media to be relayed a certain way which can limit the perspective of the audience as they see only the manipulated effect. 
            In this way, we lose part of the truth. If the audience could see the real work, at least the work is kept original, and by doing so, we can each have our own ideas from the work. 
            The latter is freer and allows more possibilities to arise from a work.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Live broadcast allows the audience to see the real setting which maintains the truth and allows the audience to see the real deal. 
            This is especially important in the news as they need to let the audience have their own interpretation, and manipulations can lead to false information, leading to distrust.
