            The “fluidity of the digital” to me means the shifting of a photo from an objectively still solid to a flexible imaginary object. 
        </p>
        <p>
            On the surface, the photo is an image. However, on a deeper note photos work like magic. 
            The object being taken is relayed to another's eyes even though the surroundings may be completely different. 
            Being able to see the exact image of a moment, also has been a power carried down through many generations. 
            Even though each generation may have used its own styles, aesthetics, and concepts, they all depict the “fluidity of the digital” by using a photo to relay a story. 
            In this way, a photo is not just a singularly defined thing but rather flexible in shape and in imagination.  
            After all, the “fluidity of the digital” can also correlate to the image viewpoint from the photographer to the audience. 
            The photographer may take a photo with a certain image in mind, however, the audience may see the photo in another completely different light. 
            The change and variety an image can carry are depicted in the line “fluidity of the digital”.
        </p>

            The objective ability of a photo depends on the photographer's thoughts and goals, but also on the reader's eyes and perspectives. 
            If the photographer insists that the photo is objective in their mind, then it is from their perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through all the books ad media around us, we craft our own perspective. 
            As a result, we all see things through a certain lens. At times, the media itself may be objective, such as news or text, but we can place meaning in it from our knowledge bank. 
            With this concept, we can also think meaningful news or text is objective as it matches our perspective of objective.   
        </p>
        <p>
            They see the photo in a certain way, and their thought process invades their viewpoint to see the motive behind the photo. 
            On the other hand, the photo is also free for interpretation in anyone else's mind. 
            We are our own individuals so we are all allowed to decide if a photo is objective or not, but only to ourselves. 
            Even if I think a photo is objective, it doesn't mean you need to, too. 
            Everyone's viewpoint of objective is different, so a photo can be objective on a personal level but never definitely on an “everyone” level.
